# Bandon Summer Festival

<!--- Website overview -->
This is the first year that the fictional Bandon Summer Festival is taking place and the Bandon Business Association committee, who are organising the festival, has decided that they want to have an online presence. The website will provide the users of the site with information about what events are taking place during the three day festival, at what time they are on and where they are taking place. A handy map of Bandon is provided. The site also outlines information about who is sponsoring the festival and allows users to give feedback to the committee about any topic they wish to raise.

<!--- Outline the features of the website -->
# Features

Both the header and the footer of the website are consistent across each of the pages. The navigation menu items also appear at the top of each page for ease of navigation. The header tells us what the name of the festival is and clearly outlines the dates the festival takes place on. The document title which appears in the tab heading also states the same details.

The page footer provides links to the social media sites of the Bandon Business Association and links to the sponsors of the festival.

The map page provides a map of Bandon town.

</p>

<!--- Future reference -->
    - The map that is provided is just a screenshot of a map of Bandon town, it is not an interactive map and does not allow the user to click on it. For future reference, this map should be fully interactive and display each of the event venues.

The feedback page provides a facility to give feedback about the festival.

<!--- Feedback page image -->
- Feedback
<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/images/feedback.jpg"/>
</p>

<!--- Future reference -->
    - This feedback form provided is just an example of how a user can provide feedback to the organisers of the festival. When the submit button is clicked the feedback is not saved to a database. For future reference, this feedback should be saved to a back-end database.

### Features Left to Implement

<!--- Future reference -->
- As this is a fictional summer festival, if this were a website for a live festival event, a separate page would be provided giving more details about each of the festival events.
