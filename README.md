# Bandon Summer Festival

This is the first year that the Bandon Summer Festival is taking place and the Bandon Business Association committee have decided that they want to have an online presence. The website will provide the users of the site with information about what events are taking place during the three day festival, at what time they are on and where they are taking place. A handy map of Bandon is provided. The site also outlines information about who is sponsoring the festival and allows users to give feedback to the committee about any topic they wish to raise.  

## Features

Both the header and the footer of the website is consistent across each of the pages. The header tells us what the name of the festival is and clearly outlines the dates the festival takes place on. The document title which appears in the tab heading also states the same details. The page footer provides links to the social media sites of the Bandon Business Association, who are organising the festival. Links to the sponsors of the festival are also provided. The home page provides some information about the festival and who is organising it. The navigation menu items also appear at top of each page for ease of navigation.
